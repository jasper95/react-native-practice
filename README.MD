# React Native Exam App

## Installation

```
  yarn
```

## Running the App

```
  yarn start
```

## Limitations

I was not able to test the App with Mobile emulators on my machine since I still have to download bunch of stuff like XCode and Android Emulators. I don't have phone adapter to my MacBook at the moment so I just use expo to test on my mobile phone.
